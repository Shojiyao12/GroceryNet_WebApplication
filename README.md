# GroceryNet_WebApplication
A GroceryNet application built using Streamlit for the classification and segmentation of grocery product images. The system leverages a multicolor dual-input CNN model with parallel U-Net architecture and pre-trained ResNeXt50_32x4d encoders. It uses the Hierarchical Grocery Store Dataset for training and evaluation.
